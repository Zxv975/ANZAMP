25	Tim	Garoni	A Limit Theorem for the Coupling Time of the Stochastic Ising Model	The coupling time of the stochastic Ising model is the random time required for processes started in the all-plus and all-minus states to coalesce, when coupled in the natural way. We show that, for any dimension d, and sufficiently high temperature, the (appropriately standardised) coupling time of the stochastic Ising model on d-dimensional tori tends weakly to a Gumbel distribution.

	Jules	Lamers	An Exactly Solvable Long-range Spin Chain: The q-deformed Haldane-Shastry Model	The celebrated Haldane--Shastry model is a long-range spin chain enjoying quantum-affine symmetries already at finite system size. Its q-deformation, i.e. partially isotropic or XXZ-like version, was found by D. Uglov back in '95 in an e-print that seems to have gone by unnoticed. Recently we managed to express this Hamiltonian in a more friendly, pairwise form that makes hermiticity for real q manifest. After reviewing the model I will present its -- for now conjectural -- exact (highest-weight) eigenvectors for finite size. With respect to a modification of the coordinate basis involving R-matrices, the wave functions are a Vandermonde factor squared times a Macdonald polynomial (with t=q^2). This is ongoing work together with V. Pasquier and D. Serban.

	Jon	Links	Controlled Tunneling of Dipolar Bosons in a Triple-well Potential	A model of dipolar bosons conﬁned to three coupled wells will be introduced and analysed. The main result of this research is a protocol for achieving controlled tunneling, via analytic formulae for frequency and amplitude, through variation of an external field. The role and consequences of integrability of the system will be discussed.
	Gabriel	Nakhl	Quantum Dark Matter Gravitational Eigenstates and a Paradigm Shift in Conceptualising Dark Matter	It has been known for some time now (Ernest, 2009a; Ernest, 2009b) that the complete set of gravitational eigenstates, obtained by applying quantum mechanics to galactic and super-galactic gravitational wells, includes an overwhelming number of well-bound, long-lived and weakly interacting ‘dark’ gravitational eigenstates, analogous to the Rydberg states of atoms. Ordinary particles such as electrons, that normally make themselves visible via optical scattering processes, would have reduced scattering cross sections if their wavefunctions contained significant numbers of these dark states in their eigenspectra. This would result in the number densities of particles being much greater than what we observe them to be, because the traditionally accepted cross sections used for density calculations would be wrong on galactic and super-galactic scales. It means that dark matter could simply be ordinary elementary particles having a “dark eigenspectral disguise”, while all the time preserving the evidence for it obtained from the cosmic microwave background and big bang nucleosynthesis. In this talk we present a continuation of the study (Whinray and Ernest, 2018) of the variation in eigenstate-interaction properties with their quantum parameters, in large gravitational systems. If the trends in the properties of gravitational eigenstates continue to behave as expected then it may well be that the high quantum-numbered, Rydberg-type gravitational eigenstates could enable ordinary particles to function as the much sort after ‘dark matter particle’, and hence provide a resolution to the dark matter problem without a need to invoke the ad hoc existence of specialized exotic, and as yet unverified, particles.
	Abrahim	Nasrawi	The Self-Avoiding Walk in a Critical Window	We are interested in some properties of the self-avoiding walk (SAW) process on the complete graph. In particular, we will be looking for how quickly the expectation and variance of walk length grows with the number of vertices, around a pseudocritical point. Yadin's paper in 2014 finds these quantities about a critical point. In this article, we will observe the behaviour of these quantities about a critical window.

30	Francesco	Ravanini	Nonlinear Integral Equations in Integrable Deformations of SU(N)/SO(N) Nonlinear Sigma Models	The Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz (TBA) equations for the class of integrable nonlinear sigma models related to SU(N)/SO(N) symmetric spaces are known since a long time. We study an integrable deformation of this symmetric space, propose the S-matrix of the deformed theory and a related set of TBA equations. We perform various checks of consistency. The TBA can be remapped into Hirota equations whose solution by suitable Q-functions leads to a set of Nonlinear integral equations (NLIE) that describe the same finite size dynamics in a more economical way. We comment on extensions of this result to other symmetric space sigma models.

	Daniel	Snell	Distinguished Curves in Projective and Conformal Geometry	Distinguished curves play an important role in the study of many geometries and are of interest for a wide range of applications.  Projective and conformal geometry are two examples of parabolic geometries and thus possess natural notions of distinguished curves. We will present a characterization of distinguished curves in these settings phrased in the language of tractor calculus, a framework well suited to the study of parabolic geometries. Conserved quantities along curves also fit nicely into the tractor description giving possible applications to integrable systems and the study of PDEs.  This is joint work with A. Rod Gover (University of Auckland) and Arman Taghavi-Chabert (American University of Beirut).
	Yury	Stepanyants	Soliton interaction with External Forcing within the Korteweg-de Vries Equation	We revise the solutions of the forced Korteweg - de Vries equation describing the resonant interaction of a solitary wave with external pulse-type perturbations. In contrast to the previous works, where only the limiting cases of very narrow forcing of delta-function type or very narrow solitary wave in comparison with the width of external perturbation were studied, we consider here an arbitrary relationship between the widths of a soliton and external perturbation. We show that in the number of particular cases the exact solutions of the forced Korteweg - de Vries equation can be obtained. We use the earlier derived approximate set of equations up to the second-order accuracy on small parameter epsilon characterising the amplitude of external force and analyse its exact (where possible) and numerical solutions. Theoretical results obtained by asymptotic method are compared with the results of direct numerical modelling within the forced Korteweg - de Vries equation.
18	Guo Chuan	Thiang	String Dualities in/from Condensed Matter	The duality concept from string theory is very powerful: there are two pictures of a single phenomenon, each with hard and easy parts. Furthermore, the duality swaps hard with easy so that it suffices to look at the easy parts of each side to obtain the full picture. At the level of functions, the Fourier transform provides such a duality. I will explain how T-duality, which is a geometric Fourier transform, arises in solid state physics and how it led to the discovery of crystallographic T-duality by K. Gomi and myself. This gives new computational tools for twisted K-theory.

	Xilin	Xu	Boundary Matrices for the Six-vertex Model	In this talk we consider solutions to the reflection equation related to the higher spin 6-vertex model. We derive difference equations for the matrix elements of the K-matrices for arbitrary spin s and solve them in terms of hypergeometric functions.
7	Zongzhen	Zhou	Two-point Functions of Random Walk Models on High-dimensional Boxes	The self-avoiding walk (SAW) on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ is known to display the same large-scale behaviour as simple random walk (SRW) when $d$ is large. In particular, the SAW and SRW Green's functions are known to display the same asymptotics when $d\ge 5$. On finite boxes, however, where SAWs must have finite length, this SAW-SRW correspondence breaks down. To recover such a correspondence, we introduce a random-length random walk (RLRW), and rigorously derive its Green's function. By combining these general RLRW results with the asymptotic walk-length distribution of the SAW on the complete graph, we obtain an explicit conjecture for the SAW Green's function on high-dimensional tori, both at criticality and within a broad family of scaling windows. Using a random walk representation of the Ising model, due to Aizenman, these conjectures extend naturally to the Ising model, where they then shed light on a number of questions under current debate by computational/theoretical physicists. Finally, we will also discuss the case of free boundary conditions, where the RLRW model again clarifies a number of actively debated questions.
